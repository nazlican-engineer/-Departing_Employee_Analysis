🎯 Departing Employee Analysis
In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data from a company to uncover the key factors behind employee departures. The main goal is to help companies enhance employee retention and develop sustainable HR strategies based on data-driven insights.

🔍 Key Questions Explored:
📆 Attrition Trends by Year: In which years was employee turnover the highest?

👩‍💼👨‍💼 Gender Distribution: What is the male–female attrition ratio?

🏢 Department-wise Analysis: Which departments have the highest turnover rates?

🎂 Attrition by Age Group: How do different age groups reflect in attrition patterns?

📊 Experience-Based Attrition: How does the number of years of experience relate to turnover?

📌 What This Project Offers to Companies:
Identify high-risk departments

Design targeted retention strategies for different age and experience groups

Address and analyze gender-related imbalances

Promote a data-informed decision-making culture

💻 Tools & Methods Used:
Created interactive dashboards using Power BI

Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations, dynamic metrics, and segmentation

Designed filters and slicers to enable user-friendly report exploration

📈 Reporting & Visualization:
All insights were visualized through meaningful charts and graphs in Power BI

Visuals are designed to support quick interpretation and deeper understanding

💡 Conclusion:
When data science meets human resources, we gain not just numbers—but insights into behavior. This project empowers companies to take measurable, strategic actions to improve employee experience and reduce turnover.
